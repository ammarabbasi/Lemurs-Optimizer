**Abstract**

The Lemur Optimizer (LO) is a novel nature-inspired algorithm we propose in this paper. This algorithm's primary inspirations are based on two pillars of lemur behaviour: leap up and dance hub. These two principles' are mathematically modelled in the optimization context to handle local search, exploitation, and exploration search concepts. The LO is first benchmarked on twenty-three standard optimization functions. Additionally, the LO is used to solve three real-world problems to evaluate its performance and effectiveness. In this direction, LO is compared to six well-known algorithms: Salp Swarm Algorithm (SSA), Artificial Bee Colony(ABC), Sine Cosine Algorithm (SCA), Bat Algorithm (BA), Flower Pollination Algorithm (FPA), and JAYA algorithm. The findings show that the proposed algorithm outperforms these algorithms in fourteen standard optimization functions and prove the LO robust performance in managing its exploration and exploitation capabilities, which significantly leads LO towards the global optimum. The real-world experimental findings demonstrate how LO may tackle such challenges competitively.
